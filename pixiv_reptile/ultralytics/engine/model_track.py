    """
        Conducts object tracking on the specified input source using the registered trackers.

        This method performs object tracking using the model's predictors and optionally registered trackers. It is
        capable of handling different types of input sources such as file paths or video streams. The method supports
        customization of the tracking process through various keyword arguments. It registers trackers if they are not
        already present and optionally persists them based on the 'persist' flag.

        The method sets a default confidence threshold specifically for ByteTrack-based tracking, which requires low
        confidence predictions as input. The tracking mode is explicitly set in the keyword arguments.

        Args:
            source (str, optional): The input source for object tracking. It can be a file path, URL, or video stream.
            stream (bool, optional): Treats the input source as a continuous video stream. Defaults to False.
            persist (bool, optional): Persists the trackers between different calls to this method. Defaults to False.
            **kwargs (any): Additional keyword arguments for configuring the tracking process. These arguments allow
                for further customization of the tracking behavior.

        Returns:
            (List[ultralytics.engine.results.Results]): A list of tracking results, encapsulated in the Results class.

        Raises:
            AttributeError: If the predictor does not have registered trackers.
