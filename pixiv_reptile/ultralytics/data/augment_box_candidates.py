        Compute box candidates based on a set of thresholds. This method compares the characteristics of the boxes
        before and after augmentation to decide whether a box is a candidate for further processing.

        Args:
            box1 (numpy.ndarray): The 4,n bounding box before augmentation, represented as [x1, y1, x2, y2].
            box2 (numpy.ndarray): The 4,n bounding box after augmentation, represented as [x1, y1, x2, y2].
            wh_thr (float, optional): The width and height threshold in pixels. Default is 2.
            ar_thr (float, optional): The aspect ratio threshold. Default is 100.
            area_thr (float, optional): The area ratio threshold. Default is 0.1.
            eps (float, optional): A small epsilon value to prevent division by zero. Default is 1e-16.

        Returns:
            (numpy.ndarray): A boolean array indicating which boxes are candidates based on the given thresholds.
