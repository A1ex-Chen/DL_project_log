def from_pretrained(cls, pretrained_model_or_path, **kwargs):
    """
        Instantiates a inpainting Pytorch diffusion pipeline from pretrained pipeline weight.

        The from_pretrained() method takes care of returning the correct pipeline class instance by:
            1. Detect the pipeline class of the pretrained_model_or_path based on the _class_name property of its
               config object
            2. Find the inpainting pipeline linked to the pipeline class using pattern matching on pipeline class name.

        If a `controlnet` argument is passed, it will instantiate a [`StableDiffusionControlNetInpaintPipeline`]
        object.

        The pipeline is set in evaluation mode (`model.eval()`) by default.

        If you get the error message below, you need to finetune the weights for your downstream task:

        ```
        Some weights of UNet2DConditionModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
        - conv_in.weight: found shape torch.Size([320, 4, 3, 3]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([320, 9, 3, 3]) in the model instantiated
        You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
        ```

        Parameters:
            pretrained_model_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                Can be either:

                    - A string, the *repo id* (for example `CompVis/ldm-text2im-large-256`) of a pretrained pipeline
                      hosted on the Hub.
                    - A path to a *directory* (for example `./my_pipeline_directory/`) containing pipeline weights
                      saved using
                    [`~DiffusionPipeline.save_pretrained`].
            torch_dtype (`str` or `torch.dtype`, *optional*):
                Override the default `torch.dtype` and load the model with another dtype. If "auto" is passed, the
                dtype is automatically derived from the model's weights.
            force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to force the (re-)download of the model weights and configuration files, overriding the
                cached versions if they exist.
            cache_dir (`Union[str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Path to a directory where a downloaded pretrained model configuration is cached if the standard cache
                is not used.
            resume_download:
                Deprecated and ignored. All downloads are now resumed by default when possible. Will be removed in v1
                of Diffusers.
            proxies (`Dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, for example, `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}`. The proxies are used on each request.
            output_loading_info(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to also return a dictionary containing missing keys, unexpected keys and error messages.
            local_files_only (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether to only load local model weights and configuration files or not. If set to `True`, the model
                won't be downloaded from the Hub.
            token (`str` or *bool*, *optional*):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, the token generated from
                `diffusers-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`) is used.
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, a commit id, or any identifier
                allowed by Git.
            custom_revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id similar to
                `revision` when loading a custom pipeline from the Hub. It can be a ðŸ¤— Diffusers version when loading a
                custom pipeline from GitHub, otherwise it defaults to `"main"` when loading from the Hub.
            mirror (`str`, *optional*):
                Mirror source to resolve accessibility issues if youâ€™re downloading a model in China. We do not
                guarantee the timeliness or safety of the source, and you should refer to the mirror site for more
                information.
            device_map (`str` or `Dict[str, Union[int, str, torch.device]]`, *optional*):
                A map that specifies where each submodule should go. It doesnâ€™t need to be defined for each
                parameter/buffer name; once a given module name is inside, every submodule of it will be sent to the
                same device.

                Set `device_map="auto"` to have ðŸ¤— Accelerate automatically compute the most optimized `device_map`. For
                more information about each option see [designing a device
                map](https://hf.co/docs/accelerate/main/en/usage_guides/big_modeling#designing-a-device-map).
            max_memory (`Dict`, *optional*):
                A dictionary device identifier for the maximum memory. Will default to the maximum memory available for
                each GPU and the available CPU RAM if unset.
            offload_folder (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                The path to offload weights if device_map contains the value `"disk"`.
            offload_state_dict (`bool`, *optional*):
                If `True`, temporarily offloads the CPU state dict to the hard drive to avoid running out of CPU RAM if
                the weight of the CPU state dict + the biggest shard of the checkpoint does not fit. Defaults to `True`
                when there is some disk offload.
            low_cpu_mem_usage (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True` if torch version >= 1.9.0 else `False`):
                Speed up model loading only loading the pretrained weights and not initializing the weights. This also
                tries to not use more than 1x model size in CPU memory (including peak memory) while loading the model.
                Only supported for PyTorch >= 1.9.0. If you are using an older version of PyTorch, setting this
                argument to `True` will raise an error.
            use_safetensors (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
                If set to `None`, the safetensors weights are downloaded if they're available **and** if the
                safetensors library is installed. If set to `True`, the model is forcibly loaded from safetensors
                weights. If set to `False`, safetensors weights are not loaded.
            kwargs (remaining dictionary of keyword arguments, *optional*):
                Can be used to overwrite load and saveable variables (the pipeline components of the specific pipeline
                class). The overwritten components are passed directly to the pipelines `__init__` method. See example
                below for more information.
            variant (`str`, *optional*):
                Load weights from a specified variant filename such as `"fp16"` or `"ema"`. This is ignored when
                loading `from_flax`.
