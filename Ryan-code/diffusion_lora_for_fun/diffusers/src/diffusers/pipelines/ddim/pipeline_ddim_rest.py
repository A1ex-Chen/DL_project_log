class DDIMPipeline(DiffusionPipeline):
    r"""
    Pipeline for image generation.

    This model inherits from [`DiffusionPipeline`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods
    implemented for all pipelines (downloading, saving, running on a particular device, etc.).

    Parameters:
        unet ([`UNet2DModel`]):
            A `UNet2DModel` to denoise the encoded image latents.
        scheduler ([`SchedulerMixin`]):
            A scheduler to be used in combination with `unet` to denoise the encoded image. Can be one of
            [`DDPMScheduler`], or [`DDIMScheduler`].
