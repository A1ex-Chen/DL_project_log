class BOTrack(STrack):
    """
    An extended version of the STrack class for YOLOv8, adding object tracking features.

    Attributes:
        shared_kalman (KalmanFilterXYWH): A shared Kalman filter for all instances of BOTrack.
        smooth_feat (np.ndarray): Smoothed feature vector.
        curr_feat (np.ndarray): Current feature vector.
        features (deque): A deque to store feature vectors with a maximum length defined by `feat_history`.
        alpha (float): Smoothing factor for the exponential moving average of features.
        mean (np.ndarray): The mean state of the Kalman filter.
        covariance (np.ndarray): The covariance matrix of the Kalman filter.

    Methods:
        update_features(feat): Update features vector and smooth it using exponential moving average.
        predict(): Predicts the mean and covariance using Kalman filter.
        re_activate(new_track, frame_id, new_id): Reactivates a track with updated features and optionally new ID.
        update(new_track, frame_id): Update the YOLOv8 instance with new track and frame ID.
        tlwh: Property that gets the current position in tlwh format `(top left x, top left y, width, height)`.
        multi_predict(stracks): Predicts the mean and covariance of multiple object tracks using shared Kalman filter.
        convert_coords(tlwh): Converts tlwh bounding box coordinates to xywh format.
        tlwh_to_xywh(tlwh): Convert bounding box to xywh format `(center x, center y, width, height)`.

    Usage:
        bo_track = BOTrack(tlwh, score, cls, feat)
        bo_track.predict()
        bo_track.update(new_track, frame_id)

class BOTSORT(BYTETracker):
    """
    An extended version of the BYTETracker class for YOLOv8, designed for object tracking with ReID and GMC algorithm.

    Attributes:
        proximity_thresh (float): Threshold for spatial proximity (IoU) between tracks and detections.
        appearance_thresh (float): Threshold for appearance similarity (ReID embeddings) between tracks and detections.
        encoder (object): Object to handle ReID embeddings, set to None if ReID is not enabled.
        gmc (GMC): An instance of the GMC algorithm for data association.
        args (object): Parsed command-line arguments containing tracking parameters.

    Methods:
        get_kalmanfilter(): Returns an instance of KalmanFilterXYWH for object tracking.
        init_track(dets, scores, cls, img): Initialize track with detections, scores, and classes.
        get_dists(tracks, detections): Get distances between tracks and detections using IoU and (optionally) ReID.
        multi_predict(tracks): Predict and track multiple objects with YOLOv8 model.

    Usage:
        bot_sort = BOTSORT(args, frame_rate)
        bot_sort.init_track(dets, scores, cls, img)
        bot_sort.multi_predict(tracks)

    Note:
        The class is designed to work with the YOLOv8 object detection model and supports ReID only if enabled via args.
