    Calculate masks IoU.

    Args:
        mask1 (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, n) where N is the number of ground truth objects and n is the
                        product of image width and height.
        mask2 (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (M, n) where M is the number of predicted objects and n is the
                        product of image width and height.
        eps (float, optional): A small value to avoid division by zero. Defaults to 1e-7.

    Returns:
        (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape (N, M) representing masks IoU.
