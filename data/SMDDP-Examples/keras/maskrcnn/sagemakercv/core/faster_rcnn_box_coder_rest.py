"""Faster RCNN box coder.

Faster RCNN box coder follows the coding schema described below:
  ty = (y - ya) / ha
  tx = (x - xa) / wa
  th = log(h / ha)
  tw = log(w / wa)
  where x, y, w, h denote the box's center coordinates, width and height
  respectively. Similarly, xa, ya, wa, ha denote the anchor's center
  coordinates, width and height. tx, ty, tw and th denote the anchor-encoded
  center, width and height respectively.

  See http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497 for details.
