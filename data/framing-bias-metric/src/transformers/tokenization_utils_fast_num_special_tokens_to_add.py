        Returns the number of added tokens when encoding a sequence with special tokens.

        .. note::
            This encodes a dummy input and checks the number of added tokens, and is therefore not efficient. Do not
            put this inside your training loop.

            pair (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`):
                Whether the number of added tokens should be computed in the case of a sequence pair or a single
                sequence.

        Returns:
            :obj:`int`: Number of special tokens added to sequences.
