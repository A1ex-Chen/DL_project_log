    Construct a "Fast" BPE tokenizer for HerBERT (backed by HuggingFace's `tokenizers` library).

    Peculiarities:

    - uses BERT's pre-tokenizer: BertPreTokenizer splits tokens on spaces, and also on punctuation. Each occurrence of
      a punctuation character will be treated separately.

    This tokenizer inherits from :class:`~transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer` which contains most of the methods. Users
    should refer to the superclass for more information regarding methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (:obj:`str`):
            Path to the vocabulary file.
        merges_file (:obj:`str`):
            Path to the merges file.
