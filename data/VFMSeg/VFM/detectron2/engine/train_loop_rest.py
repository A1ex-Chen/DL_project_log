class HookBase:
    """
    Base class for hooks that can be registered with :class:`TrainerBase`.

    Each hook can implement 4 methods. The way they are called is demonstrated
    in the following snippet:
    ::
        hook.before_train()
        for iter in range(start_iter, max_iter):
            hook.before_step()
            trainer.run_step()
            hook.after_step()
        iter += 1
        hook.after_train()

    Notes:
        1. In the hook method, users can access ``self.trainer`` to access more
           properties about the context (e.g., model, current iteration, or config
           if using :class:`DefaultTrainer`).

        2. A hook that does something in :meth:`before_step` can often be
           implemented equivalently in :meth:`after_step`.
           If the hook takes non-trivial time, it is strongly recommended to
           implement the hook in :meth:`after_step` instead of :meth:`before_step`.
           The convention is that :meth:`before_step` should only take negligible time.

           Following this convention will allow hooks that do care about the difference
           between :meth:`before_step` and :meth:`after_step` (e.g., timer) to
           function properly.

    """

    trainer: "TrainerBase" = None
    """
    A weak reference to the trainer object. Set by the trainer when the hook is registered.
    """







class TrainerBase:
    """
    Base class for iterative trainer with hooks.

    The only assumption we made here is: the training runs in a loop.
    A subclass can implement what the loop is.
    We made no assumptions about the existence of dataloader, optimizer, model, etc.

    Attributes:
        iter(int): the current iteration.

        start_iter(int): The iteration to start with.
            By convention the minimum possible value is 0.

        max_iter(int): The iteration to end training.

        storage(EventStorage): An EventStorage that's opened during the course of training.
    """












class SimpleTrainer(TrainerBase):
    """
    A simple trainer for the most common type of task:
    single-cost single-optimizer single-data-source iterative optimization,
    optionally using data-parallelism.
    It assumes that every step, you:

    1. Compute the loss with a data from the data_loader.
    2. Compute the gradients with the above loss.
    3. Update the model with the optimizer.

    All other tasks during training (checkpointing, logging, evaluation, LR schedule)
    are maintained by hooks, which can be registered by :meth:`TrainerBase.register_hooks`.

    If you want to do anything fancier than this,
    either subclass TrainerBase and implement your own `run_step`,
    or write your own training loop.
    """




    @staticmethod




class AMPTrainer(SimpleTrainer):
    """
    Like :class:`SimpleTrainer`, but uses PyTorch's native automatic mixed precision
    in the training loop.
    """
