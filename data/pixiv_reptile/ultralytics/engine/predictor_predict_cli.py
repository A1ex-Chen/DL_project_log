        Method used for Command Line Interface (CLI) prediction.

        This function is designed to run predictions using the CLI. It sets up the source and model, then processes
        the inputs in a streaming manner. This method ensures that no outputs accumulate in memory by consuming the
        generator without storing results.

        Note:
            Do not modify this function or remove the generator. The generator ensures that no outputs are
            accumulated in memory, which is critical for preventing memory issues during long-running predictions.
