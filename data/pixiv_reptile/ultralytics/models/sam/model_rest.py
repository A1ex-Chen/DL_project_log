SAM model interface.

This module provides an interface to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) from Ultralytics, designed for real-time image
segmentation tasks. The SAM model allows for promptable segmentation with unparalleled versatility in image analysis,
and has been trained on the SA-1B dataset. It features zero-shot performance capabilities, enabling it to adapt to new
image distributions and tasks without prior knowledge.

Key Features:
    - Promptable segmentation
    - Real-time performance
    - Zero-shot transfer capabilities
    - Trained on SA-1B dataset
