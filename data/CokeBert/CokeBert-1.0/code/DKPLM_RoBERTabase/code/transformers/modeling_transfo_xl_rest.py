TRANSFO_XL_START_DOCSTRING = r"""    The Transformer-XL model was proposed in
    `Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context`_
    by Zihang Dai*, Zhilin Yang*, Yiming Yang, Jaime Carbonell, Quoc V. Le, Ruslan Salakhutdinov.
    It's a causal (uni-directional) transformer with relative positioning (sinuso√Ødal) embeddings which can reuse
    previously computed hidden-states to attend to longer context (memory).
    This model also uses adaptive softmax inputs and outputs (tied).

    This model is a PyTorch `torch.nn.Module`_ sub-class. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and
    refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

    .. _`Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context`:
        https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860

    .. _`torch.nn.Module`:
        https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#module

    Parameters:
        config (:class:`~transformers.TransfoXLConfig`): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration.
            Check out the :meth:`~transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained` method to load the model weights.

    Inputs:
        **input_ids**: ``torch.LongTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.
            Transformer-XL is a model with relative position embeddings so you can either pad the inputs on
            the right or on the left.
            Indices can be obtained using :class:`transformers.TransfoXLTokenizer`.
            See :func:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode` and
            :func:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids` for details.
        **mems**: (`optional`)
            list of ``torch.FloatTensor`` (one for each layer):
            that contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) as computed by the model
            (see `mems` output below). Can be used to speed up sequential decoding and attend to longer context.
        **head_mask**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(num_heads,)`` or ``(num_layers, num_heads)``:
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules.
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` indicates the head is **not masked**, ``0`` indicates the head is **masked**.
        **inputs_embeds**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim)``:
            Optionally, instead of passing ``input_ids`` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
            This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors
            than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
