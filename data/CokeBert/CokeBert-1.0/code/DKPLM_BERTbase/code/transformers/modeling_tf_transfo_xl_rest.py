TRANSFO_XL_START_DOCSTRING = r"""    The Transformer-XL model was proposed in
    `Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context`_
    by Zihang Dai*, Zhilin Yang*, Yiming Yang, Jaime Carbonell, Quoc V. Le, Ruslan Salakhutdinov.
    It's a causal (uni-directional) transformer with relative positioning (sinuso√Ødal) embeddings which can reuse
    previously computed hidden-states to attend to longer context (memory).
    This model also uses adaptive softmax inputs and outputs (tied).

    This model is a tf.keras.Model `tf.keras.Model`_ sub-class. Use it as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and
    refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

    .. _`Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context`:
        https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860

    .. _`tf.keras.Model`:
        https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model

    Note on the model inputs:
        TF 2.0 models accepts two formats as inputs:

            - having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
            - having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional arguments.

        This second option is usefull when using `tf.keras.Model.fit()` method which currently requires having all the tensors in the first argument of the model call function: `model(inputs)`.

        If you choose this second option, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in the first positional argument :

        - a single Tensor with input_ids only and nothing else: `model(inputs_ids)
        - a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring:
            `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
        - a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associaed to the input names given in the docstring:
            `model({'input_ids': input_ids, 'token_type_ids': token_type_ids})`

    Parameters:
        config (:class:`~transformers.TransfoXLConfig`): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration.
            Check out the :meth:`~transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained` method to load the model weights.

TRANSFO_XL_INPUTS_DOCSTRING = r"""
    Inputs:
        **input_ids**: ``Numpy array`` or ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.
            Transformer-XL is a model with relative position embeddings so you can either pad the inputs on
            the right or on the left.
            Indices can be obtained using :class:`transformers.TransfoXLTokenizer`.
            See :func:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode` and
            :func:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids` for details.
        **mems**: (`optional`)
            list of ``Numpy array`` or ``tf.Tensor`` (one for each layer):
            that contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) as computed by the model
            (see `mems` output below). Can be used to speed up sequential decoding and attend to longer context.
        **head_mask**: (`optional`) ``Numpy array`` or ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(num_heads,)`` or ``(num_layers, num_heads)``:
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules.
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` indicates the head is **not masked**, ``0`` indicates the head is **masked**.
        **inputs_embeds**: (`optional`) ``Numpy array`` or ``tf.Tensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim)``:
            Optionally, instead of passing ``input_ids`` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
            This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors
            than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
