    """Multi-head grouped query attention (GQA) layer.

    Reference:
        "GQA: Training Generalized Multi-Query Transformer Models from Multi-Head Checkpoints"
        https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245v1.pdf

    GQA is a variant of multihead attention (MHA) that uses fewer write heads
    (key / value) than query heads.  GQA can be viewed as a generalization of
    multi-query attention (MQA), which uses a single write head. GQA and MQA give
    significant speedups over standard MHA in decoder layers, with minimal loss in
    accuracy. In the paper, GQA is shown to be more accurate than MQA, while still
    having a significant speedup over MHA.

    NOTE: The original authors only benchmark GQA by adapting the T5 (XL or XXL) model
    from MHA to GQA.  As a result, they do not mention parameter initialization or
    layer normalization strategies.  I follow the best practices laid out in the
    MAGNETO paper, which improves Transformer performance through better parameter
    initialization and layer norm placement.  See:
        https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06423.pdf, Fig. 2
