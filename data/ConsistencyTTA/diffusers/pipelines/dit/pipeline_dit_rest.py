    This pipeline inherits from [`DiffusionPipeline`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all the pipelines (such as downloading or saving, running on a particular device, etc.)

    Parameters:
        transformer ([`Transformer2DModel`]):
            Class conditioned Transformer in Diffusion model to denoise the encoded image latents.
        vae ([`AutoencoderKL`]):
            Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) Model to encode and decode images to and from latent representations.
        scheduler ([`DDIMScheduler`]):
            A scheduler to be used in combination with `dit` to denoise the encoded image latents.
