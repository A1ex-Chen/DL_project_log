class CyclicLR(Callback):
    """This callback implements a cyclical learning rate policy (CLR).
    The method cycles the learning rate between two boundaries with
    some constant frequency.

    Parameters
    ----------
        base_lr: initial learning rate which is the
            lower boundary in the cycle.
        max_lr: upper boundary in the cycle. Functionally,
            it defines the cycle amplitude (max_lr - base_lr).
            The lr at any cycle is the sum of base_lr
            and some scaling of the amplitude; therefore
            max_lr may not actually be reached depending on
            scaling function.
        step_size: number of training iterations per
            half cycle. Authors suggest setting step_size
            2-8 x training iterations in epoch.
        mode: one of {triangular, triangular2, exp_range}.
            Default 'triangular'.
            Values correspond to policies detailed above.
            If scale_fn is not None, this argument is ignored.
        gamma: constant in 'exp_range' scaling function:
            gamma**(cycle iterations)
        scale_fn: Custom scaling policy defined by a single
            argument lambda function, where
            0 <= scale_fn(x) <= 1 for all x >= 0.
            mode paramater is ignored
        scale_mode: {'cycle', 'iterations'}.
            Defines whether scale_fn is evaluated on
            cycle number or cycle iterations (training
            iterations since start of cycle). Default is 'cycle'.

    The amplitude of the cycle can be scaled on a per-iteration or
    per-cycle basis.
    This class has three built-in policies, as put forth in the paper.
    "triangular":
        A basic triangular cycle w/ no amplitude scaling.
    "triangular2":
        A basic triangular cycle that scales initial amplitude by half each cycle.
    "exp_range":
        A cycle that scales initial amplitude by gamma**(cycle iterations) at each
        cycle iteration.
    For more detail, please see paper.

    # Example for CIFAR-10 w/ batch size 100:
        ```python
            clr = CyclicLR(base_lr=0.001, max_lr=0.006,
                                step_size=2000., mode='triangular')
            model.fit(X_train, Y_train, callbacks=[clr])
        ```

    Class also supports custom scaling functions:
        ```python
            clr_fn = lambda x: 0.5*(1+np.sin(x*np.pi/2.))
            clr = CyclicLR(base_lr=0.001, max_lr=0.006,
                                step_size=2000., scale_fn=clr_fn,
                                scale_mode='cycle')
            model.fit(X_train, Y_train, callbacks=[clr])
        ```
