# An Empirical Study of Logging Practice in CUDA-based Deep Learning Systems



This project is a replication package for the paper titled **"An Empirical Study of Logging Practice in CUDA-based Deep Learning Systems"** . The paper proposes an empirical study to examine the characteristics and rationales of logging practices in CUDA-based deep learning (DL) systems.

## **Purpose**



In this repository, we propose a pipeline that extracts both general and DL-specific logs from selected projects.

## **Folders Overview**



### **dataset**



Contains method level python code files for each selected subjects.

### **DL-logging**



Includes Python scripts for:

- Downloading projects that imported selected libraries by using GitHub Search API
- Extracting logging statements
