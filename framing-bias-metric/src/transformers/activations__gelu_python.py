    Original Implementation of the GELU activation function in Google BERT repo when initially created. For
    information: OpenAI GPT's GELU is slightly different (and gives slightly different results): 0.5 * x * (1 +
    torch.tanh(math.sqrt(2 / math.pi) * (x + 0.044715 * torch.pow(x, 3)))) This is now written in C in
    torch.nn.functional Also see the Gaussian Error Linear Units paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415
