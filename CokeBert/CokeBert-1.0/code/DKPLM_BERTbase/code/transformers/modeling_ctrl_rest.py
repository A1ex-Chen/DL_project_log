CTRL_START_DOCSTRING = r"""    CTRL model was proposed in 
    `CTRL: A Conditional Transformer Language Model for Controllable Generation`_
    by Nitish Shirish Keskar*, Bryan McCann*, Lav R. Varshney, Caiming Xiong and Richard Socher.
    It's a causal (unidirectional) transformer pre-trained using language modeling on a very large
    corpus of ~140 GB of text data with the first token reserved as a control code (such as Links, Books, Wikipedia etc.).

    This model is a PyTorch `torch.nn.Module`_ sub-class. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and
    refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

    .. _`CTRL: A Conditional Transformer Language Model for Controllable Generation`:
        https://www.github.com/salesforce/ctrl

    .. _`torch.nn.Module`:
        https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#module

    Parameters:
        config (:class:`~transformers.CTRLConfig`): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration.
            Check out the :meth:`~transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained` method to load the model weights.

CTRL_INPUTS_DOCSTRING = r"""    Inputs:
        **input_ids**: ``torch.LongTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.
            CTRL is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on
            the right rather than the left.
            Indices can be obtained using :class:`transformers.CTRLTokenizer`.
            See :func:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode` and
            :func:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids` for details.
        **past**:
            list of ``torch.FloatTensor`` (one for each layer):
            that contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) as computed by the model
            (see `past` output below). Can be used to speed up sequential decoding. The token ids which have their past given to this model 
            should not be passed as input ids as they have already been computed.
        **attention_mask**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices.
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` for tokens that are NOT MASKED, ``0`` for MASKED tokens.
        **token_type_ids**: (`optional`) ``torch.LongTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            A parallel sequence of tokens (can be used to indicate various portions of the inputs).
            The embeddings from these tokens will be summed with the respective token embeddings.
            Indices are selected in the vocabulary (unlike BERT which has a specific vocabulary for segment indices).
        **position_ids**: (`optional`) ``torch.LongTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Indices of positions of each input sequence tokens in the position embeddings.
            Selected in the range ``[0, config.max_position_embeddings - 1]``.
        **head_mask**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(num_heads,)`` or ``(num_layers, num_heads)``:
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules.
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` indicates the head is **not masked**, ``0`` indicates the head is **masked**.
        **inputs_embeds**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim)``:
            Optionally, instead of passing ``input_ids`` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
            This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors
            than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.
