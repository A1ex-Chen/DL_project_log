            The predicted denoised sample `(x_{0})` based on the model output from the current timestep.
            `pred_original_sample` can be used to preview progress or for guidance.

class EDMEulerScheduler(SchedulerMixin, ConfigMixin):

    Implements the Euler scheduler in EDM formulation as presented in Karras et al. 2022 [1].

    [1] Karras, Tero, et al. "Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models."
    https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364

    This model inherits from [`SchedulerMixin`] and [`ConfigMixin`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic
    methods the library implements for all schedulers such as loading and saving.

    Args:
        sigma_min (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.002):
            Minimum noise magnitude in the sigma schedule. This was set to 0.002 in the EDM paper [1]; a reasonable
            range is [0, 10].
        sigma_max (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 80.0):
            Maximum noise magnitude in the sigma schedule. This was set to 80.0 in the EDM paper [1]; a reasonable
            range is [0.2, 80.0].
        sigma_data (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.5):
            The standard deviation of the data distribution. This is set to 0.5 in the EDM paper [1].
        sigma_schedule (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `karras`):
            Sigma schedule to compute the `sigmas`. By default, we the schedule introduced in the EDM paper
            (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364). Other acceptable value is "exponential". The exponential schedule was
            incorporated in this model: https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/cosxl.
        num_train_timesteps (`int`, defaults to 1000):
            The number of diffusion steps to train the model.
        prediction_type (`str`, defaults to `epsilon`, *optional*):
            Prediction type of the scheduler function; can be `epsilon` (predicts the noise of the diffusion process),
            `sample` (directly predicts the noisy sample`) or `v_prediction` (see section 2.4 of [Imagen
            Video](https://imagen.research.google/video/paper.pdf) paper).
        rho (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 7.0):
            The rho parameter used for calculating the Karras sigma schedule, which is set to 7.0 in the EDM paper [1].
