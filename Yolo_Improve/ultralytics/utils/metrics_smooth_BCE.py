    Computes smoothed positive and negative Binary Cross-Entropy targets.

    This function calculates positive and negative label smoothing BCE targets based on a given epsilon value.
    For implementation details, refer to https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3/issues/238#issuecomment-598028441.

    Args:
        eps (float, optional): The epsilon value for label smoothing. Defaults to 0.1.

    Returns:
        (tuple): A tuple containing the positive and negative label smoothing BCE targets.
