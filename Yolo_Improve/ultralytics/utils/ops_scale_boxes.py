    """
    Rescales bounding boxes (in the format of xyxy by default) from the shape of the image they were originally
    specified in (img1_shape) to the shape of a different image (img0_shape).

    Args:
        img1_shape (tuple): The shape of the image that the bounding boxes are for, in the format of (height, width).
        boxes (torch.Tensor): the bounding boxes of the objects in the image, in the format of (x1, y1, x2, y2)
        img0_shape (tuple): the shape of the target image, in the format of (height, width).
        ratio_pad (tuple): a tuple of (ratio, pad) for scaling the boxes. If not provided, the ratio and pad will be
            calculated based on the size difference between the two images.
        padding (bool): If True, assuming the boxes is based on image augmented by yolo style. If False then do regular
            rescaling.
        xywh (bool): The box format is xywh or not, default=False.

    Returns:
        boxes (torch.Tensor): The scaled bounding boxes, in the format of (x1, y1, x2, y2)
