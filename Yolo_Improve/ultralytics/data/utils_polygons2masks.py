    Convert a list of polygons to a set of binary masks of the specified image size.

    Args:
        imgsz (tuple): The size of the image as (height, width).
        polygons (list[np.ndarray]): A list of polygons. Each polygon is an array with shape [N, M], where
                                     N is the number of polygons, and M is the number of points such that M % 2 = 0.
        color (int): The color value to fill in the polygons on the masks.
        downsample_ratio (int, optional): Factor by which to downsample each mask. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        (np.ndarray): A set of binary masks of the specified image size with the polygons filled in.
