        An alias for the predict method, enabling the model instance to be callable.

        This method simplifies the process of making predictions by allowing the model instance to be called directly
        with the required arguments for prediction.

        Args:
            source (str | Path | int | PIL.Image | np.ndarray, optional): The source of the image for making
                predictions. Accepts various types, including file paths, URLs, PIL images, and numpy arrays.
                Defaults to None.
            stream (bool, optional): If True, treats the input source as a continuous stream for predictions.
                Defaults to False.
            **kwargs (any): Additional keyword arguments for configuring the prediction process.

        Returns:
            (List[ultralytics.engine.results.Results]): A list of prediction results, encapsulated in the Results class.
        """
    return self.predict(source, stream, **kwargs)
