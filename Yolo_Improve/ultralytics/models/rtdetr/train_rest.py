class RTDETRTrainer(DetectionTrainer):
    """
    Trainer class for the RT-DETR model developed by Baidu for real-time object detection. Extends the DetectionTrainer
    class for YOLO to adapt to the specific features and architecture of RT-DETR. This model leverages Vision
    Transformers and has capabilities like IoU-aware query selection and adaptable inference speed.

    Notes:
        - F.grid_sample used in RT-DETR does not support the `deterministic=True` argument.
        - AMP training can lead to NaN outputs and may produce errors during bipartite graph matching.

    Example:
        ```python
        from ultralytics.models.rtdetr.train import RTDETRTrainer

        args = dict(model='rtdetr-l.yaml', data='coco8.yaml', imgsz=640, epochs=3)
        trainer = RTDETRTrainer(overrides=args)
        trainer.train()
        ```
