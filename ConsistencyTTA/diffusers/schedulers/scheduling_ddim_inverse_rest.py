    DDIMInverseScheduler is the reverse scheduler of [`DDIMScheduler`].

    [`~ConfigMixin`] takes care of storing all config attributes that are passed in the scheduler's `__init__`
    function, such as `num_train_timesteps`. They can be accessed via `scheduler.config.num_train_timesteps`.
    [`SchedulerMixin`] provides general loading and saving functionality via the [`SchedulerMixin.save_pretrained`] and
    [`~SchedulerMixin.from_pretrained`] functions.

    For more details, see the original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502

    Args:
        num_train_timesteps (`int`): number of diffusion steps used to train the model.
        beta_start (`float`): the starting `beta` value of inference.
        beta_end (`float`): the final `beta` value.
        beta_schedule (`str`):
            the beta schedule, a mapping from a beta range to a sequence of betas for stepping the model. Choose from
            `linear`, `scaled_linear`, or `squaredcos_cap_v2`.
        trained_betas (`np.ndarray`, optional):
            option to pass an array of betas directly to the constructor to bypass `beta_start`, `beta_end` etc.
        clip_sample (`bool`, default `True`):
            option to clip predicted sample for numerical stability.
        clip_sample_range (`float`, default `1.0`):
            the maximum magnitude for sample clipping. Valid only when `clip_sample=True`.
        set_alpha_to_zero (`bool`, default `True`):
            each diffusion step uses the value of alphas product at that step and at the previous one. For the final
            step there is no previous alpha. When this option is `True` the previous alpha product is fixed to `0`,
            otherwise it uses the value of alpha at step `num_train_timesteps - 1`.
        steps_offset (`int`, default `0`):
            an offset added to the inference steps. You can use a combination of `offset=1` and
            `set_alpha_to_zero=False`, to make the last step use step `num_train_timesteps - 1` for the previous alpha
            product.
        prediction_type (`str`, default `epsilon`, optional):
            prediction type of the scheduler function, one of `epsilon` (predicting the noise of the diffusion
            process), `sample` (directly predicting the noisy sample`) or `v_prediction` (see section 2.4
            https://imagen.research.google/video/paper.pdf)
