    Scheduler created by @crowsonkb in [k_diffusion](https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion), see:
    https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion/blob/5b3af030dd83e0297272d861c19477735d0317ec/k_diffusion/sampling.py#L188

    Scheduler inspired by DPM-Solver-2 and Algorthim 2 from Karras et al. (2022).

    [`~ConfigMixin`] takes care of storing all config attributes that are passed in the scheduler's `__init__`
    function, such as `num_train_timesteps`. They can be accessed via `scheduler.config.num_train_timesteps`.
    [`SchedulerMixin`] provides general loading and saving functionality via the [`SchedulerMixin.save_pretrained`] and
    [`~SchedulerMixin.from_pretrained`] functions.

    Args:
        num_train_timesteps (`int`): number of diffusion steps used to train the model. beta_start (`float`): the
        starting `beta` value of inference. beta_end (`float`): the final `beta` value. beta_schedule (`str`):
            the beta schedule, a mapping from a beta range to a sequence of betas for stepping the model. Choose from
            `linear` or `scaled_linear`.
        trained_betas (`np.ndarray`, optional):
            option to pass an array of betas directly to the constructor to bypass `beta_start`, `beta_end` etc.
            options to clip the variance used when adding noise to the denoised sample. Choose from `fixed_small`,
            `fixed_small_log`, `fixed_large`, `fixed_large_log`, `learned` or `learned_range`.
        prediction_type (`str`, default `epsilon`, optional):
            prediction type of the scheduler function, one of `epsilon` (predicting the noise of the diffusion
            process), `sample` (directly predicting the noisy sample`) or `v_prediction` (see section 2.4
            https://imagen.research.google/video/paper.pdf)
