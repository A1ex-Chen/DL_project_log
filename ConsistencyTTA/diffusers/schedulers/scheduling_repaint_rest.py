    RePaint is a schedule for DDPM inpainting inside a given mask.

    [`~ConfigMixin`] takes care of storing all config attributes that are passed in the scheduler's `__init__`
    function, such as `num_train_timesteps`. They can be accessed via `scheduler.config.num_train_timesteps`.
    [`SchedulerMixin`] provides general loading and saving functionality via the [`SchedulerMixin.save_pretrained`] and
    [`~SchedulerMixin.from_pretrained`] functions.

    For more details, see the original paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.09865.pdf

    Args:
        num_train_timesteps (`int`): number of diffusion steps used to train the model.
        beta_start (`float`): the starting `beta` value of inference.
        beta_end (`float`): the final `beta` value.
        beta_schedule (`str`):
            the beta schedule, a mapping from a beta range to a sequence of betas for stepping the model. Choose from
            `linear`, `scaled_linear`, or `squaredcos_cap_v2`.
        eta (`float`):
            The weight of noise for added noise in a diffusion step. Its value is between 0.0 and 1.0 -0.0 is DDIM and
            1.0 is DDPM scheduler respectively.
        trained_betas (`np.ndarray`, optional):
            option to pass an array of betas directly to the constructor to bypass `beta_start`, `beta_end` etc.
        variance_type (`str`):
            options to clip the variance used when adding noise to the denoised sample. Choose from `fixed_small`,
            `fixed_small_log`, `fixed_large`, `fixed_large_log`, `learned` or `learned_range`.
        clip_sample (`bool`, default `True`):
            option to clip predicted sample between -1 and 1 for numerical stability.
