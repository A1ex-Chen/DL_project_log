class DPMSolverMultistepScheduler(SchedulerMixin, ConfigMixin):
    """
    DPM-Solver (and the improved version DPM-Solver++) is a fast dedicated high-order solver for diffusion ODEs with
    the convergence order guarantee. Empirically, sampling by DPM-Solver with only 20 steps can generate high-quality
    samples, and it can generate quite good samples even in only 10 steps.

    For more details, see the original paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00927 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01095

    Currently, we support the multistep DPM-Solver for both noise prediction models and data prediction models. We
    recommend to use `solver_order=2` for guided sampling, and `solver_order=3` for unconditional sampling.

    We also support the "dynamic thresholding" method in Imagen (https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487). For pixel-space
    diffusion models, you can set both `algorithm_type="dpmsolver++"` and `thresholding=True` to use the dynamic
    thresholding. Note that the thresholding method is unsuitable for latent-space diffusion models (such as
    stable-diffusion).

    We also support the SDE variant of DPM-Solver and DPM-Solver++, which is a fast SDE solver for the reverse
    diffusion SDE. Currently we only support the first-order and second-order solvers. We recommend using the
    second-order `sde-dpmsolver++`.

    [`~ConfigMixin`] takes care of storing all config attributes that are passed in the scheduler's `__init__`
    function, such as `num_train_timesteps`. They can be accessed via `scheduler.config.num_train_timesteps`.
    [`SchedulerMixin`] provides general loading and saving functionality via the [`SchedulerMixin.save_pretrained`] and
    [`~SchedulerMixin.from_pretrained`] functions.

    Args:
        num_train_timesteps (`int`): number of diffusion steps used to train the model.
        beta_start (`float`): the starting `beta` value of inference.
        beta_end (`float`): the final `beta` value.
        beta_schedule (`str`):
            the beta schedule, a mapping from a beta range to a sequence of betas for stepping the model. Choose from
            `linear`, `scaled_linear`, or `squaredcos_cap_v2`.
        trained_betas (`np.ndarray`, optional):
            option to pass an array of betas directly to the constructor to bypass `beta_start`, `beta_end` etc.
        solver_order (`int`, default `2`):
            the order of DPM-Solver; can be `1` or `2` or `3`. We recommend to use `solver_order=2` for guided
            sampling, and `solver_order=3` for unconditional sampling.
        prediction_type (`str`, default `epsilon`, optional):
            prediction type of the scheduler function, one of `epsilon` (predicting the noise of the diffusion
            process), `sample` (directly predicting the noisy sample`) or `v_prediction` (see section 2.4
            https://imagen.research.google/video/paper.pdf)
        thresholding (`bool`, default `False`):
            whether to use the "dynamic thresholding" method (introduced by Imagen, https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487).
            For pixel-space diffusion models, you can set both `algorithm_type=dpmsolver++` and `thresholding=True` to
            use the dynamic thresholding. Note that the thresholding method is unsuitable for latent-space diffusion
            models (such as stable-diffusion).
        dynamic_thresholding_ratio (`float`, default `0.995`):
            the ratio for the dynamic thresholding method. Default is `0.995`, the same as Imagen
            (https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487).
        sample_max_value (`float`, default `1.0`):
            the threshold value for dynamic thresholding. Valid only when `thresholding=True` and
            `algorithm_type="dpmsolver++`.
        algorithm_type (`str`, default `dpmsolver++`):
            the algorithm type for the solver. Either `dpmsolver` or `dpmsolver++` or `sde-dpmsolver` or
            `sde-dpmsolver++`. The `dpmsolver` type implements the algorithms in https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00927, and
            the `dpmsolver++` type implements the algorithms in https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01095. We recommend to use
            `dpmsolver++` or `sde-dpmsolver++` with `solver_order=2` for guided sampling (e.g. stable-diffusion).
        solver_type (`str`, default `midpoint`):
            the solver type for the second-order solver. Either `midpoint` or `heun`. The solver type slightly affects
            the sample quality, especially for small number of steps. We empirically find that `midpoint` solvers are
            slightly better, so we recommend to use the `midpoint` type.
        lower_order_final (`bool`, default `True`):
            whether to use lower-order solvers in the final steps. Only valid for < 15 inference steps. We empirically
            find this trick can stabilize the sampling of DPM-Solver for steps < 15, especially for steps <= 10.
        use_karras_sigmas (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
             This parameter controls whether to use Karras sigmas (Karras et al. (2022) scheme) for step sizes in the
             noise schedule during the sampling process. If True, the sigmas will be determined according to a sequence
             of noise levels {Ïƒi} as defined in Equation (5) of the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00364.pdf.
        lambda_min_clipped (`float`, default `-inf`):
            the clipping threshold for the minimum value of lambda(t) for numerical stability. This is critical for
            cosine (squaredcos_cap_v2) noise schedule.
        variance_type (`str`, *optional*):
            Set to "learned" or "learned_range" for diffusion models that predict variance. For example, OpenAI's
            guided-diffusion (https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion) predicts both mean and variance of the
            Gaussian distribution in the model's output. DPM-Solver only needs the "mean" output because it is based on
            diffusion ODEs. whether the model's output contains the predicted Gaussian variance. For example, OpenAI's
            guided-diffusion (https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion) predicts both mean and variance of the
            Gaussian distribution in the model's output. DPM-Solver only needs the "mean" output because it is based on
            diffusion ODEs.
