    Euler scheduler (Algorithm 2) from Karras et al. (2022) https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364. . Based on the original
    k-diffusion implementation by Katherine Crowson:
    https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion/blob/481677d114f6ea445aa009cf5bd7a9cdee909e47/k_diffusion/sampling.py#L51

    [`~ConfigMixin`] takes care of storing all config attributes that are passed in the scheduler's `__init__`
    function, such as `num_train_timesteps`. They can be accessed via `scheduler.config.num_train_timesteps`.
    [`SchedulerMixin`] provides general loading and saving functionality via the [`SchedulerMixin.save_pretrained`] and
    [`~SchedulerMixin.from_pretrained`] functions.

    Args:
        num_train_timesteps (`int`): number of diffusion steps used to train the model.
        beta_start (`float`): the starting `beta` value of inference.
        beta_end (`float`): the final `beta` value.
        beta_schedule (`str`):
            the beta schedule, a mapping from a beta range to a sequence of betas for stepping the model. Choose from
            `linear` or `scaled_linear`.
        trained_betas (`np.ndarray`, optional):
            option to pass an array of betas directly to the constructor to bypass `beta_start`, `beta_end` etc.
        prediction_type (`str`, default `"epsilon"`, optional):
            prediction type of the scheduler function, one of `epsilon` (predicting the noise of the diffusion
            process), `sample` (directly predicting the noisy sample`) or `v_prediction` (see section 2.4
            https://imagen.research.google/video/paper.pdf)
        interpolation_type (`str`, default `"linear"`, optional):
            interpolation type to compute intermediate sigmas for the scheduler denoising steps. Should be one of
            [`"linear"`, `"log_linear"`].
