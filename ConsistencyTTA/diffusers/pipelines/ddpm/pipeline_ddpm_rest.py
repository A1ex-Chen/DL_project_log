class DDPMPipeline(DiffusionPipeline):
    r"""
    This model inherits from [`DiffusionPipeline`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all the pipelines (such as downloading or saving, running on a particular device, etc.)

    Parameters:
        unet ([`UNet2DModel`]): U-Net architecture to denoise the encoded image.
        scheduler ([`SchedulerMixin`]):
            A scheduler to be used in combination with `unet` to denoise the encoded image. Can be one of
            [`DDPMScheduler`], or [`DDIMScheduler`].
