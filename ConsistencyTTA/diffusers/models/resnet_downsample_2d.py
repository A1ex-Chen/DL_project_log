def downsample_2d(hidden_states, kernel=None, factor=2, gain=1):
    """Downsample2D a batch of 2D images with the given filter.
    Accepts a batch of 2D images of the shape `[N, C, H, W]` or `[N, H, W, C]` and downsamples each image with the
    given filter. The filter is normalized so that if the input pixels are constant, they will be scaled by the
    specified `gain`. Pixels outside the image are assumed to be zero, and the filter is padded with zeros so that its
    shape is a multiple of the downsampling factor.

    Args:
        hidden_states: Input tensor of the shape `[N, C, H, W]` or `[N, H, W, C]`.
        kernel: FIR filter of the shape `[firH, firW]` or `[firN]`
          (separable). The default is `[1] * factor`, which corresponds to average pooling.
        factor: Integer downsampling factor (default: 2).
        gain: Scaling factor for signal magnitude (default: 1.0).

    Returns:
        output: Tensor of the shape `[N, C, H // factor, W // factor]`
