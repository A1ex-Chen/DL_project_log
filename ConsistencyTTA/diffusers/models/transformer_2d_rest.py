class Transformer2DModel(ModelMixin, ConfigMixin):
    """
    Transformer model for image-like data. Takes either discrete (classes of vector embeddings) or continuous (actual
    embeddings) inputs.

    When input is continuous: First, project the input (aka embedding) and reshape to b, t, d. Then apply standard
    transformer action. Finally, reshape to image.

    When input is discrete: First, input (classes of latent pixels) is converted to embeddings and has positional
    embeddings applied, see `ImagePositionalEmbeddings`. Then apply standard transformer action. Finally, predict
    classes of unnoised image.

    Note that it is assumed one of the input classes is the masked latent pixel. The predicted classes of the unnoised
    image do not contain a prediction for the masked pixel as the unnoised image cannot be masked.

    Parameters:
        num_attention_heads (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 16): The number of heads to use for multi-head attention.
        attention_head_dim (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 88): The number of channels in each head.
        in_channels (`int`, *optional*):
            Pass if the input is continuous. The number of channels in the input and output.
        num_layers (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1): The number of layers of Transformer blocks to use.
        dropout (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0): The dropout probability to use.
        cross_attention_dim (`int`, *optional*): The number of encoder_hidden_states dimensions to use.
        sample_size (`int`, *optional*): Pass if the input is discrete. The width of the latent images.
            Note that this is fixed at training time as it is used for learning a number of position embeddings.
            See `ImagePositionalEmbeddings`.
        num_vector_embeds (`int`, *optional*):
            Pass if the input is discrete. The number of classes of the vector embeddings of the latent pixels.
            Includes the class for the masked latent pixel.
        activation_fn (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"geglu"`): Activation function to be used in feed-forward.
        num_embeds_ada_norm ( `int`, *optional*): Pass if at least one of the norm_layers is `AdaLayerNorm`.
            The number of diffusion steps used during training. Note that this is fixed at training time as it is
            used to learn a number of embeddings that are added to the hidden states. During inference, you can
            denoise for up to but not more than steps than `num_embeds_ada_norm`.
        attention_bias (`bool`, *optional*):
            Configure if the TransformerBlocks' attention should contain a bias parameter.
