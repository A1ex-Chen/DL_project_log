    """INT8 Calibrator Class for Imagenet-based Image Classification Models.

    Parameters
    ----------
    calibration_files: List[str]
        List of image filenames to use for INT8 Calibration
    batch_size: int
        Number of images to pass through in one batch during calibration
    input_shape: Tuple[int]
        Tuple of integers defining the shape of input to the model (Default: (3, 224, 224))
    cache_file: str
        Name of file to read/write calibration cache from/to.
    preprocess_func: function -> numpy.ndarray
        Pre-processing function to run on calibration data. This should match the pre-processing
        done at inference time. In general, this function should return a numpy array of
        shape `input_shape`.
