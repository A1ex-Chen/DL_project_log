class MultiheadAttention(nn.Module):
    r"""Allows the model to jointly attend to information
    from different representation subspaces.
    See `Attention Is All You Need <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762>`_

    .. math::
        \text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(head_1,\dots,head_h)W^O

    where :math:`head_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)`.

    Args:
        embed_dim: total dimension of the model.
        num_heads: parallel attention heads.
        dropout: a Dropout layer on attn_output_weights. Default: 0.0.
        bias: add bias as module parameter. Default: True.
        add_bias_kv: add bias to the key and value sequences at dim=0.
        add_zero_attn: add a new batch of zeros to the key and
                       value sequences at dim=1.
        kdim: total number of features in key. Default: None.
        vdim: total number of features in value. Default: None.

    Note that if :attr:`kdim` and :attr:`vdim` are None, they will be set
    to :attr:`embed_dim` such that query, key, and value have the same
    number of features.

    Examples::

        >>> multihead_attn = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim, num_heads)
        >>> attn_output, attn_output_weights = multihead_attn(query, key, value)
