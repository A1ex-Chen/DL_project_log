        Args:
            output_size (tuple): h, w
            spatial_scale (float): scale the input boxes by this number
            sampling_ratio (int): number of inputs samples to take for each output
                sample. 0 to take samples densely.
            aligned (bool): if False, use the legacy implementation in
                Detectron. If True, align the results more perfectly.

        Note:
            The meaning of aligned=True:

            Given a continuous coordinate c, its two neighboring pixel indices (in our
            pixel model) are computed by floor(c - 0.5) and ceil(c - 0.5). For example,
            c=1.3 has pixel neighbors with discrete indices [0] and [1] (which are sampled
            from the underlying signal at continuous coordinates 0.5 and 1.5). But the original
            roi_align (aligned=False) does not subtract the 0.5 when computing neighboring
            pixel indices and therefore it uses pixels with a slightly incorrect alignment
            (relative to our pixel model) when performing bilinear interpolation.

            With `aligned=True`,
            we first appropriately scale the ROI and then shift it by -0.5
            prior to calling roi_align. This produces the correct neighbors; see
            detectron2/tests/test_roi_align.py for verification.

            The difference does not make a difference to the model's performance if
            ROIAlign is used together with conv layers.
