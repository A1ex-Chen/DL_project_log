    Let the global config point to the given cfg.

    Assume that the given "cfg" has the key "KEY", after calling
    `set_global_cfg(cfg)`, the key can be accessed by:
    ::
        from detectron2.config import global_cfg
        print(global_cfg.KEY)

    By using a hacky global config, you can access these configs anywhere,
    without having to pass the config object or the values deep into the code.
    This is a hacky feature introduced for quick prototyping / research exploration.
