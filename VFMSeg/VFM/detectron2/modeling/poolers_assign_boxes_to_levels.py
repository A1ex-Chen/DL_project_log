def assign_boxes_to_levels(box_lists: List[Boxes], min_level: int,

    """
    Map each box in `box_lists` to a feature map level index and return the assignment
    vector.

    Args:
        box_lists (list[Boxes] | list[RotatedBoxes]): A list of N Boxes or N RotatedBoxes,
            where N is the number of images in the batch.
        min_level (int): Smallest feature map level index. The input is considered index 0,
            the output of stage 1 is index 1, and so.
        max_level (int): Largest feature map level index.
        canonical_box_size (int): A canonical box size in pixels (sqrt(box area)).
        canonical_level (int): The feature map level index on which a canonically-sized box
            should be placed.

    Returns:
        A tensor of length M, where M is the total number of boxes aggregated over all
            N batch images. The memory layout corresponds to the concatenation of boxes
            from all images. Each element is the feature map index, as an offset from
            `self.min_level`, for the corresponding box (so value i means the box is at
            `self.min_level + i`).
