## Note: Non-smooth surfaces or bad triangulations may lead to non-spiral orderings of the vertices.
## Common issue in badly triangulated surfaces is that there exist some edges that belong to more than two triangles. In this
## case the mathematical definition of the spiral is insufficient. In this case, in this version of the code, we randomly
## choose two triangles in order to continue the inductive assignment of the order to the rest of the vertices.
