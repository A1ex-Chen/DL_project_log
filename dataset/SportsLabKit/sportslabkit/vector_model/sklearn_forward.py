def forward(self, inputs: Vector, **kwargs: Any) ->Vector:
    """
        Implement the forward pass specific to scikit-learn pipelines.

        This method takes a vector input and passes it through the scikit-learn pipeline's
        `predict` method. Additional keyword arguments can be passed to the `predict` method
        via **kwargs.

        Args:
            inputs (Vector): The input vector, which should match the expected input shape of the pipeline.
            **kwargs (Any): Additional keyword arguments to pass to the pipeline's `predict` method.

        Returns:
            Vector: The output vector from the pipeline's `predict` method.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the model attribute is None, indicating that the model has not been loaded.
