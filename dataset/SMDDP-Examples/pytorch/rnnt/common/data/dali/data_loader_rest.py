class DaliDataLoader:

    DataLoader is the main entry point to the data preprocessing pipeline.
    To use, create an object and then just iterate over `data_iterator`.
    DataLoader will do the rest for you.
    Example:
        data_layer = DataLoader(DaliTrainPipeline, path, json, bs, ngpu)
        data_it = data_layer.data_iterator
        for data in data_it:
            print(data)  # Here's your preprocessed data

    Args:
        device_type: Which device to use for preprocessing. Choose: "cpu", "gpu"
        pipeline_type: Choose: "train", "val"
