class ImagePositionalEmbeddings(nn.Module):
    """
    Converts latent image classes into vector embeddings. Sums the vector embeddings with positional embeddings for the
    height and width of the latent space.

    For more details, see figure 10 of the dall-e paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12092

    For VQ-diffusion:

    Output vector embeddings are used as input for the transformer.

    Note that the vector embeddings for the transformer are different than the vector embeddings from the VQVAE.

    Args:
        num_embed (`int`):
            Number of embeddings for the latent pixels embeddings.
        height (`int`):
            Height of the latent image i.e. the number of height embeddings.
        width (`int`):
            Width of the latent image i.e. the number of width embeddings.
        embed_dim (`int`):
            Dimension of the produced vector embeddings. Used for the latent pixel, height, and width embeddings.

class LabelEmbedding(nn.Module):

    Embeds class labels into vector representations. Also handles label dropout for classifier-free guidance.

    Args:

        hidden_size (`int`): The size of the vector embeddings.
        dropout_prob (`float`): The probability of dropping a label.
