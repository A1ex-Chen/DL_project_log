        Enable sliced attention computation.

        When this option is enabled, the attention module will split the input tensor in slices, to compute attention
        in several steps. This is useful to save some memory in exchange for a small speed decrease.

        Args:
            slice_size (`str` or `int`, *optional*, defaults to `"auto"`):
                When `"auto"`, halves the input to the attention heads, so attention will be computed in two steps. If
                `"max"`, maximum amount of memory will be saved by running only one slice at a time. If a number is
                provided, uses as many slices as `attention_head_dim // slice_size`. In this case, `attention_head_dim`
                must be a multiple of `slice_size`.
