    Apply masks to bounding boxes using the output of the mask head.

        protos (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape [mask_dim, mask_h, mask_w].
        masks_in (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape [n, mask_dim], where n is the number of masks after NMS.
        bboxes (torch.Tensor): A tensor of shape [n, 4], where n is the number of masks after NMS.
        shape (tuple): A tuple of integers representing the size of the input image in the format (h, w).
        upsample (bool): A flag to indicate whether to upsample the mask to the original image size. Default is False.

        (torch.Tensor): A binary mask tensor of shape [n, h, w], where n is the number of masks after NMS, and h and w
            are the height and width of the input image. The mask is applied to the bounding boxes.
