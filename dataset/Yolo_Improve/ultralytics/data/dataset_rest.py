class ClassificationDataset:
    """
    Extends torchvision ImageFolder to support YOLO classification tasks, offering functionalities like image
    augmentation, caching, and verification. It's designed to efficiently handle large datasets for training deep
    learning models, with optional image transformations and caching mechanisms to speed up training.

    This class allows for augmentations using both torchvision and Albumentations libraries, and supports caching images
    in RAM or on disk to reduce IO overhead during training. Additionally, it implements a robust verification process
    to ensure data integrity and consistency.

    Attributes:
        cache_ram (bool): Indicates if caching in RAM is enabled.
        cache_disk (bool): Indicates if caching on disk is enabled.
        samples (list): A list of tuples, each containing the path to an image, its class index, path to its .npy cache
                        file (if caching on disk), and optionally the loaded image array (if caching in RAM).
        torch_transforms (callable): PyTorch transforms to be applied to the images.
