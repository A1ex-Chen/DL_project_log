XLNET_START_DOCSTRING = r"""    The XLNet model was proposed in
    `XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding`_
    by Zhilin Yang*, Zihang Dai*, Yiming Yang, Jaime Carbonell, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Quoc V. Le.
    XLnet is an extension of the Transformer-XL model pre-trained using an autoregressive method
    to learn bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations
    of the input sequence factorization order.

    The specific attention pattern can be controlled at training and test time using the `perm_mask` input.

    Do to the difficulty of training a fully auto-regressive model over various factorization order,
    XLNet is pretrained using only a sub-set of the output tokens as target which are selected
    with the `target_mapping` input.

    To use XLNet for sequential decoding (i.e. not in fully bi-directional setting), use the `perm_mask` and
    `target_mapping` inputs to control the attention span and outputs (see examples in `examples/run_generation.py`)

    This model is a PyTorch `torch.nn.Module`_ sub-class. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and
    refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

    .. _`XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding`:
        http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237

    .. _`torch.nn.Module`:
        https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#module

    Parameters:
        config (:class:`~transformers.XLNetConfig`): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration.
            Check out the :meth:`~transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained` method to load the model weights.

XLNET_INPUTS_DOCSTRING = r"""
    Inputs:
        **input_ids**: ``torch.LongTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.
            XLNet is a model with relative position embeddings so you can either pad the inputs on
            the right or on the left.
            Indices can be obtained using :class:`transformers.XLNetTokenizer`.
            See :func:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.encode` and
            :func:`transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids` for details.
        **token_type_ids**: (`optional`) ``torch.LongTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            A parallel sequence of tokens (can be used to indicate various portions of the inputs).
            The type indices in XLNet are NOT selected in the vocabulary, they can be arbitrary numbers and
            the important thing is that they should be different for tokens which belong to different segments.
            The model will compute relative segment differences from the given type indices:
            0 if the segment id of two tokens are the same, 1 if not.
        **attention_mask**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices.
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` for tokens that are NOT MASKED, ``0`` for MASKED tokens.
        **mems**: (`optional`)
            list of ``torch.FloatTensor`` (one for each layer):
            that contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the attention blocks) as output by the model
            (see `mems` output below). Can be used to speed up sequential decoding and attend to longer context.
            To activate mems you need to set up config.mem_len to a positive value which will be the max number of tokens in
            the memory output by the model. E.g. `model = XLNetModel.from_pretrained('xlnet-base-case, mem_len=1024)` will
            instantiate a model which can use up to 1024 tokens of memory (in addition to the input it self).
        **perm_mask**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length, sequence_length)``:
            Mask to indicate the attention pattern for each input token with values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            If ``perm_mask[k, i, j] = 0``, i attend to j in batch k;
            if ``perm_mask[k, i, j] = 1``, i does not attend to j in batch k.
            If None, each token attends to all the others (full bidirectional attention).
            Only used during pretraining (to define factorization order) or for sequential decoding (generation).
        **target_mapping**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, num_predict, sequence_length)``:
            Mask to indicate the output tokens to use.
            If ``target_mapping[k, i, j] = 1``, the i-th predict in batch k is on the j-th token.
            Only used during pretraining for partial prediction or for sequential decoding (generation).
        **token_type_ids**: (`optional`) ``torch.LongTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            A parallel sequence of tokens (can be used to indicate various portions of the inputs).
            The type indices in XLNet are NOT selected in the vocabulary, they can be arbitrary numbers and
            the important thing is that they should be different for tokens which belong to different segments.
            The model will compute relative segment differences from the given type indices:
            0 if the segment id of two tokens are the same, 1 if not.
        **input_mask**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length)``:
            Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices.
            Negative of `attention_mask`, i.e. with 0 for real tokens and 1 for padding.
            Kept for compatibility with the original code base.
            You can only uses one of `input_mask` and `attention_mask`
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` for tokens that are MASKED, ``0`` for tokens that are NOT MASKED.
        **head_mask**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(num_heads,)`` or ``(num_layers, num_heads)``:
            Mask to nullify selected heads of the self-attention modules.
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            ``1`` indicates the head is **not masked**, ``0`` indicates the head is **masked**.
        **inputs_embeds**: (`optional`) ``torch.FloatTensor`` of shape ``(batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim)``:
            Optionally, instead of passing ``input_ids`` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation.
            This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors
            than the model's internal embedding lookup matrix.

            Labels for position (index) of the end of the labelled span for computing the token classification loss.
