class PretrainedConfig(object):
    r""" Base class for all configuration classes.
        Handles a few parameters common to all models' configurations as well as methods for loading/downloading/saving configurations.

        Note:
            A configuration file can be loaded and saved to disk. Loading the configuration file and using this file to initialize a model does **not** load the model weights.
            It only affects the model's configuration.

        Class attributes (overridden by derived classes):
            - ``pretrained_config_archive_map``: a python ``dict`` of with `short-cut-names` (string) as keys and `url` (string) of associated pretrained model configurations as values.

        Parameters:
            ``finetuning_task``: string, default `None`. Name of the task used to fine-tune the model. This can be used when converting from an original (TensorFlow or PyTorch) checkpoint.
            ``num_labels``: integer, default `2`. Number of classes to use when the model is a classification model (sequences/tokens)
            ``output_attentions``: boolean, default `False`. Should the model returns attentions weights.
            ``output_hidden_states``: string, default `False`. Should the model returns all hidden-states.
            ``torchscript``: string, default `False`. Is the model used with Torchscript.
