    """
    A single training/test example for simple sequence classification.

    Args:
        guid: Unique id for the example.
        text_a: string. The untokenized text of the first sequence. For single
        sequence tasks, only this sequence must be specified.
        text_b: (Optional) string. The untokenized text of the second sequence.
        Only must be specified for sequence pair tasks.
        label: (Optional) string. The label of the example. This should be
        specified for train and dev examples, but not for test examples.

    A single set of features of data.

    Args:
        input_ids: Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.
        attention_mask: Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices.
            Mask values selected in ``[0, 1]``:
            Usually  ``1`` for tokens that are NOT MASKED, ``0`` for MASKED (padded) tokens.
        token_type_ids: Segment token indices to indicate first and second portions of the inputs.
        label: Label corresponding to the input
