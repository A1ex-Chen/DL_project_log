    Output class for the scheduler's `step` function output.

        prev_sample (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_channels, height, width)` for images):
            Computed sample `(x_{t-1})` of previous timestep. `prev_sample` should be used as next model input in the
            denoising loop.
        pred_original_sample (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, num_channels, height, width)` for images):
            The predicted denoised sample `(x_{0})` based on the model output from the current timestep.
            `pred_original_sample` can be used to preview progress or for guidance.
