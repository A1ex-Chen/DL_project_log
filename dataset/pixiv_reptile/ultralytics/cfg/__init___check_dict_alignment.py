def check_dict_alignment(base: Dict, custom: Dict, e=None):
    """
    Check for key alignment between custom and base configuration dictionaries, catering for deprecated keys and
    providing informative error messages for mismatched keys.

    Args:
        base (dict): The base configuration dictionary containing valid keys.
        custom (dict): The custom configuration dictionary to be checked for alignment.
        e (Exception, optional): An optional error instance passed by the calling function. Default is None.

    Raises:
        SystemExit: Terminates the program execution if mismatched keys are found.

    Notes:
        - The function provides suggestions for mismatched keys based on their similarity to valid keys in the
          base configuration.
        - Deprecated keys in the custom configuration are automatically handled and replaced with their updated
          equivalents.
        - A detailed error message is printed for each mismatched key, helping users to quickly identify and correct
          their custom configurations.

    Example:
        ```python
        base_cfg = {'epochs': 50, 'lr0': 0.01, 'batch_size': 16}
        custom_cfg = {'epoch': 100, 'lr': 0.02, 'batch_size': 32}

        try:
            check_dict_alignment(base_cfg, custom_cfg)
        except SystemExit:
            # Handle the error or correct the configuration
        ```
